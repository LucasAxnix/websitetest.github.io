# Website

We're using Github pages alongside Jekyll to generate our website

## Developing

### Environment

Ensure you have the [requirements](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements) installed in order to build locally.

To run the site locally run `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --port 4001`  
Then you can access it at `localhost:4001`

### New pages

Create a new `.md` file in the root directory and follow the practices of the other md files or here's a nice [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to follow. This is also a good [repo](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs) as an example to look at.
